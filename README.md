# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Final project of an online course where the main goal is to learn how to get and clean data

In this repository, two scripts are to be found and have the following function. One of the scripts is an .R file in which the code that
contains the analysis of provided data is presented. This code actually obtains data and cleans it according to the specifications in the
project. The second script is an .md file that contains the full description of how the code in the already mentioned .R file works. 
Furthermore, it explains how the code fulfills the specifications given in the project, as well as it explains everything needed in order
to understand how the data is cleaned and organized.

It is very important to note that the scripts are going to be run under the assumption that the folder with the raw data, which was 
provided in this project, is to be downloaded and unzipped in the working directory exactly from the link that was given. Therefore, in 
order to manipulate the files in the downloaded folder, the used file paths to read the data assume the existence of the two folders where 
the files with the samsung data are contained when the link provided for this project is used. This is explained more in detail in the code 
book once one see the accordance of the file paths of the reading functions (read.table) and the creation of an additional folder when
one downloads the files from the link provided.
